#Please RAM is a crucial component that ensures a system's correct operation. 
>Simply put, RAM is equivalent to short-term memory, where your system stores information while working on a current task. Therefore, defective【有缺陷】 memory can have a catastrophic【灾难性】 impact on your work. In most cases, RAM typically outlasts the rest of the components inside your system, unless you're transitioning from an old standard to a new one, like DDR4 to DDR5. It's rare for RAM to fail, but it does happen. Like any computer part, even the best RAM will eventually fail, so you'll want to know what to do when it happens to you.
>RAM doesn't usually stop working out of the blue. Often, there are early signs of a failing or faulty DIMM. But yes, receiving DOA (dead on arrival) RAM isn't uncommon, like any other PC component. General symptoms of bad RAM include random blue screens of death (BSOD), system crashes or restarts, operating system freezes, and missing memory. In a worst-case scenario, your system might not even post and welcome you with multiple beeps.
